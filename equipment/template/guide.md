<!-- TITLE: Guide -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Guide -->

> This page needs to contain the complete information needed for someone to be able to use the machine.
> 
> The laser cutter home page contains a stripped down "Getting Started Guide" which will operate as a refresher and contain the bare basics.
> 
> This page needs to contain more information, including ALL safety issues operators need to be aware of, and instructions on how to do less common tasks (i.e., eventually the rotary tool for the laser cutter).
> 
> You can break it into multiple page if needed.

<!-- TITLE: Operators Manual -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Almost everything you need to know to safely operate the laser cutter -->

Before completing your online quiz and in person induction, you will need to review the [SOP](), [Quick Start Guide](), and the *New Operators* section below.

> ℹ️ **Preventing Information Overload**
> It may seem like a lot of information, but you will have a printed copy of the *Quick Start Guide* and the instructor to help you through your first few cuts. As such, take your time to get it right. A calm and relaxed operator is a safe operator. You will have the opportunity to be able to keep cutting under supervision until you can cut safely on your own.

The articles on this page should be refered to any time you are completing an operation, and you aren't certain on how to proceed. It will likely reference the manufactuers [Instruction Manual]() at some points, and it is important to recognise that these articles are designed to completement the *Instruction Manual* rather than replace it.

<!-- TITLE: Training Guide -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Training Guide -->

> This page should contain the information that trainers need to know before inducting a new operator.
> 
> It should also contain step by step instructions on how to train them the first time a new operator comes in, and what is required when supervising their first dozen or so jobs.
> 
> The step by step instructions on how to train someone should ideally also be printed/laminated and kept in the lab.

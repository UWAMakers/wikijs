> This page is intended to be read by Equipment Managers only. You are likely looking for the [Main Page](/equipment/laser) or the [Operators Manual](/equipment/laser/manual) if you are already an operator, or trying to become one. If you are not an Equipment Manager and you read ahead anyway, you MUST NOT attempt anything described beyond this point unless instructed to do so by an Equipment Manager.

This page will need to detail:

a. training required to become an equipment manager (EMS safety want them to complete a laser course for example)
b. what other information an EM needs to know before they can train someone
c. a script for training a new operator after they've completed the online portion of the training

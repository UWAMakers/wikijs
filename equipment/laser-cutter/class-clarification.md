# Class Clarification for the Laser Cutter

The Redsail RS807050 CO2 Laser Cutter operated by UWA Makers is officially considered a class two laser product that uses a class four laser and this is reflected in the stickers on the body of the laser cutter. Formerly the stickers on the laser cutter stated that it was a class four laser cutter, however this was a mistake on the manufacturers part and was clarified in [this email](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sdKLqyTt0NmnFJ7vTyODV_h49n6GnS9e) and subsequently the class four sticker was replaced by the manufacturer with the current sticker. A summary of laser classes can be found on the Worksafe Australia website [here](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/laser-classification-and-potential-hazards).

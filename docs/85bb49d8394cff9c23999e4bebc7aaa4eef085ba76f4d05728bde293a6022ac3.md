# Errata

* \[21460003-090419]: The SOP needs to be updated to reflect minor changes from when it was located in G.21 originally
	* \[21460003-090419]: Air con doesn't need to be on anymore as a safety measure
	* \[21460003-090419]: There is no official log book, althrough you should report near misses and problems to the Equipment Manager
	* \[21460003-090419]: We should standardise around the term `Equipment Manager` or `Equipment Supervisor`, but for now they are interchangeable
* \[21460003-090419]: `idementsu` should be `idemtsu` at Step 11

# Changelog

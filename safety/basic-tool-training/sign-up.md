Makers are currently handling bookings for all staff and student who are required to attend an EMS Basic Tool Training Workshop. Please book in using the system provided below. 

Aim to attend one of the workshops that already has people booked in where possible. We may have to cancel sessions that have not received enough bookings (typically 6 people required at minimum).

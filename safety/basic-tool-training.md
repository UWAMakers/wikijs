Everyone who participates in practical activities involving tools around the *Faculty of Matematical and Engineering Sciences* at UWA are required by the faculty to complete a basic tool training induction. This includes all students working on any project in the Makers Lab. This also applies to using basic hand tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, etc.

*The UWA Makers are also currently responsible for booking in students from other student groups who are required to complete the tool training.*

> ℹ️&nbsp; **Prior Experience**
>
> Unfortunately, there is no provision to be exempted from the required training – regardless of your past professional or academic experiences (this includes tool specific training completed as part of a unit).
> 
> We understand the additional burden this places on some of our mentors and other highly skilled volunteers especially, and we are grateful for their patience.

Completing the required basic hand tool training course through the faculty will mean you are able to use the following tools inside the Makers Lab:

* Handtools (such as utility knives, scredrivers, chisels, etc.)
* Power Drill
* Circular Saws
* Jigsaws
* Recipricating Saws
* Dremel / Proxxon

3. Attend the workshop and bring a copy of your certificate
4. Get [signed off by the instructor](#instructor-sign-off) at the end of the workshop via the Access Portal

## Downloading your certificate

To get your certificate, you first need to carefully read each section in the module and complete the two quizzes.

Once done, you can click the link titled 'Certificate' in the sidebar and then click on the printer icon. You can use the usual print dialog to create a PDF.

Make sure you bring a copy of your certificate with you to the in-person workshop. It's fine to show the instructor a digital copy on your phone if you want to save the trees!

## Booking Into a Workshop

<a href="https://bookwhen.com/uwamakers" title="Book online"><img src="https://d1abtw6bgq2xi2.cloudfront.net/images/bookonline_button.png" alt="Book online" style="width:315px;height:66px;" /></a>

Basic tool training workshops are **typically held the last Friday of the month and start at 8am**. Additional workshops may be run (typically in Semester One) if there is demand from students, and availability of staff.

> ⚠️&nbsp; **Quota for Workshop Bookings**
> 
> There are usually eight spots available each session. We require six people booked in for the scheduled session to go ahead.
> Please be mindful that workshops may not go ahead if there are not enough participants. You will be notified in advance if this is the case.
{.is-warning}

The process for booking into a workshop may change from time to time, depending on when workshops are being run. As such, the best way to begin booking is by clicking on the relevant link in the UWA Makers Access Portal. This will take you to the right place.

**You probably found this page from there, but here is how to find it if you didn't:**

**Follow Steps 1 to 3** from the '*Booking Into a Workshop*' section above at the end of the workshop (use your mobile phone, or other portable device)

If you are a member of the Makers who has access to the Makers Lab and has [registered their campus card on the Makers' Access Portal](#), the relevant RFID locks protecting power tools with now be unlockable by you.

> ⚠️&nbsp; **Be Safe!**
>
> Make sure you always ask for help if you are uncertain on how to use any of the equipment you now have access to.
> Always remember that access to tools are a privilege, not a right. Improper use may result in your access to tools or even access to the lab being removed at any time.
{.is-warning}

> 🚨&nbsp; **Reading the SOPs**
> 
> Always read the Standard Operating Procedures before you start work with any of the equipment in the lab.
> This is important as the SOP may change at any time. Ensuring you read them means we don't have to retrain everyone anytime something small changes.
> More details about SOPs can be found [here](https://wiki.uwamakers.com/safety/SOP)
